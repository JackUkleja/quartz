The 3 months, August through October 2009 were a very prolific period for my blogging. I think I had just been made redundant from Amnesia (subsequently Amnesia Razorfish, subsequently Razorfish https://www.razorfish.com.au/) and was living on Railway Parade, Erskineville. I had grand visions about becoming an entreprenur, constantly dreaming up ideas for various websites and apps (such as a Couch to 5K) but never got around to building any. I did seem to enjoy writing for a brief period though. My unexpected hit was an blog I wrote about getting the 3G modem working on a ThinkPad - Windows 7 had just been released and gained wide adoption, but various bits of hardware didn't quite work without  tweaking. Once I saw the traffic, I embedded Google AdWords and made about $150 for 150k impressions. Exciting times.
